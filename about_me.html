                    Hi! My name is Laura O&#39;Malley, and I&#39;m currently a Junior English major at UMass Amherst. I am pursuing letters of specialization in the Study and Practice of Writing, Professional Writing and Technical Communication, and Creative Writing. I&#39;m also working on an Information Technology minor and a Music minor in Percussion Performance. (The picture up top is a close up of Marimba keys).
                </p>

                <p>My major has led me to be invested in finding ways to communicate clearly, and my specialization in Professional Writing and Technical Communication has allowed me to explore how I might extend that to technical or UX writing. I&#39;m also passionate about alternate forms of communication, especially music. I love working collaboratively across artforms, and was fortunate enough to contribute to my friend Thomas Wilson&#39;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/428331567625600/">graduate recital</a> in this way.</p> 

                <p>In my free time, I love reading and exploring western Mass. I&#39;m also an active member of the University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band as a member of the drumline.</p>
