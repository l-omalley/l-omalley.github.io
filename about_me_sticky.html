                <h1>About Me</h1>
                
                <p>Hi! My name is Laura O’Malley, and I’m currently a Junior English major at UMass Amherst. I am pursuing letters of specialization in the Study and Practice of Writing, Professional Writing and Technical Communication, and Creative Writing. I’m also working on an Information Technology minor and a Music minor in Percussion Performance. (The picture up top is a close up of Marimba keys).</p>

                <p>My major has led me to be invested in finding ways to communicate clearly, and my specialization in Professional Writing and Technical Communication has allowed me to explore how I might extend that to technical or UX writing. I’m also passionate about alternate forms of communication, especially music. I love working collaboratively across artforms, and was fortunate enough to contribute to my friend Thomas Wilson’s graduate recital in this way.</p> 

                <p>In my free time, I love reading and exploring western Mass. I’m also an active member of the University of Massachusetts Minuteman Marching Band as a member of the drum line (go phi b d!).</p>
